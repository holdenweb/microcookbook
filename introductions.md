## Daniel "DQ" Quadros

Hi, my name is Daniel Quadros. 

I am an Electronic Engineer, but I have always worked as a software developer. Hardware is a hobby for me and, for the last two decades, I had a lot of fun with microcontrollers and participating in the [Garoa Hacker Clube](https://garoa.net.br/wiki/Garoa_Hacker_Clube:About).

I have a [blog](https://dqsoft.blogspot.com/) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DanielQuadros), both in Portuguese (I live in Brazil). You can find the code for some of my projects at [github](https://github.com/dquadros)  More recently, I started a [blog](https://raspico.blogspot.com/) (in English) about my experiences with the Raspberry Pi Pico (and other boards based on the RP2040 and the RP2350). In the 80s I wrote a few books about programming the IBM PC in Assembly language. It took me a long time, but I've started writing books again; the results (so far) are [Knowing the RP2040](https://leanpub.com/rp2040) and [Using Sensors with the Raspberry Pi Pico](https://leanpub.com/picosensors).
